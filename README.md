BGPlay.js provides a graphical and intuitive representation of the inter-domain routing and its evolution over time.

It has been developed as a part of the Master’s thesis of [Massimo Candela](http://massimocandela.com) at the 
[Computer Network Research Group](https://compunet.ing.uniroma3.it/) of Roma Tre University (Italy) 
in collaboration with [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net). 

The project is ***open source, see LICENSE.txt*** for more information.
The modular architecture of this project allowed the creation of some others tools based on it, e.g. [Radian](http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~compunet/projects/radian/).

You can embed this tool in your service for free, but please use a [proper acknowledgment](http://bgplay.massimocandela.com/bgplay-doc/#copyright).
