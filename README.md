BGPlay.js (+ real-time version!)
==========================
***News: This repo contains the classic BGPlay + the real-time version. It has received many performance improvements affecting both the versions.***

BGPlay.js provides a graphical and intuitive representation of the inter-domain routing and its evolution over time.

It has been developed as a part of the Master’s thesis of [Massimo Candela](http://massimocandela.com) at the 
[Computer Network Research Group](http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~compunet/) of Roma Tre University (Italy) 
in collaboration with [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net). 

Today the tool still maintained by [Massimo Candela](http://massimocandela.com) in his free time.

The project is ***open source, see LICENSE.txt*** for more information.
The modular architecture of this project allowed the creation of some others tools based on it, e.g. TPlay (now renamed Radian).

You can embed this tool in your service for free, or share instances/screenshots, but please **use a proper acknowledgment** as described [here](http://bgplay.massimocandela.com#copyright).
